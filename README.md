<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Đại</h1>

👋 Greetings Flutter Aficionados! I'm Dai, your friendly neighborhood Flutter Developer. If Flutter were a sport, I'd be the MVP! 🏆 I've been fluttering around the development scene for 4 years (with a total of 8 years in mobile development), and my code speaks Dart fluently (and maybe a bit of sarcasm).


🚀 Flutter Superpowers:

🚀 Flying high in crafting sleek and responsive mobile apps with Flutter.

🌐 Fluent in Dart, the language that makes Flutter sing (and sometimes tell a joke or two).

⚙️ Master of state management, widget acrobatics, and making performance optimization look easy.

⚡ Fun fact: I love to play **Badminton** and drink **Beer**
